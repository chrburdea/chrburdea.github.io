												<p>Operational costs in public bus transportation are mainly influenced by personnel and bus operations. Therefore, planning needs to be as accurate as possible. Usually solved with heuristcs, my Master thesis uses reinforcement learning instead - a approach that had not been pursued in research thus far.
													<br>
													<br>Focusing on the Vehicle Scheduling Problem, the RL agent generalizes problems and to make it advantageous over heuristics which need repetitive customizations. The thesis showed, that Reinforcement Learning can be used to learn optimization tasks. With an optimiality gap of 23.17%, the performance was not satisfying and is related to the architecture of the agent. Therefore, more research will be neccesary. The full thesis can be accessed on my linkedIn page.

												<p> A joint project with Tobias Lange that was developed during the first pandemic-related lockdown. Our goal was to learn more about Computer Vision as we were both fascinated by this technology, but only had a vague idea about its implementation. Using openCV and various mathematic libraries, we developed a tool that is able to measure a hand simply by using a coin as a reference.<br><br>We realized that poor lighting and a noisy background inhibits precise results. Nevertheless, our code is able to provide measurements with a usual deviation of only +-3mm.</p>

												<p>As part of my curriculum, I have worked for 5 months on a research project in cooperation with Lufthansa. To reduce the calculation time necessary to create pilot duties, the project had the goal to develop an engine which is able to reduce the search space of the problem. Instead of predicting likely airports that a pilot will be routed to, predictions will be made about highly unlikely airports which can be excluded during the duty creation with a confidence of ~99%.<br><br>Using a Feed Forward Neural Network, I was able to exclude on average 71% of all possible airports which resulted in a significant increase of 41% compared to statistical methods.</p>

Using a dataset with Kobe Bryant's shots during his time at the NBA, we conducted a data science project following the CRISP-DM stages.<br><br>After data preparation, we conducted numerous hypothesis-based examinations and used basic prediction models like Random Forest or logistic regression. A special focus has been set on accurate data modelling and representation as well as a differentiated evaluation of the prediction results.</p>

													<p>Tinder is one of the most used dating platforms. A part of their success is based on well-engineerd matching algorithms for suggesting users (Elo Score). Our course project simulated the app to analyze the impact and emergent effect caused by the hidden dynamics. We initialized a population of 10.000 agents to represent the user base and their preference-based behaviour. Using published data as a reference, we aimed to adjust the parameters to recreate a realistic environment.<br><br>We were able to replicate agent experiences based on age groups and gender. Furthermore we simulated the effect that the scoring has on the user base. </p>
